                        The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (“the Global Fund”) is established to support countries in need in their efforts aimed at mitigating the impact caused by HIV and AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and to poverty reduction as part of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and now the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The Global Fund allocates resources through public-private partnerships between the government, civil society, private sector and affected communities. Sustainability and success of Global Fund-funded programs and projects depends on strong country-driven, coordinated, multi-sectoral and comprehensive approaches involving all relevant partners; effective planning and development and implementation of programs; monitoring and evaluation; and decision-making related to the allocation and utilization of Global Fund financial resources.

                        The Cambodia Country Coordinating Committee (“CCC”)is a national multi-sectoral body founded in 2003 for coordinating the Global Fund supported activities in Cambodia. The Country Coordinating Committee was established as a mechanism for representation of the national stakeholder constituencies for the three diseases in Cambodia, and in line with the requirements and recommendations of the Global Fund. The CCC mechanism has been effective and contributed to better outcomes of Global Fund-funded programs and projects through effective coordination of Global Fund-related activities.

                        The Global Fund Grants to Cambodia have produced remarkable results in reducing the instances of HIV/AIDs, Tuberculosis and Malaria and strengthening the sustainability of the health system over the period from 2003 to 2017. Over these years, the capacity of the Royal Government of Cambodia (Government) and in particular the Ministry of Health (MOH), to implement the Global Fund Grants has increased significantly. There is greater ownership of the programs by the Government and MOH. The Government has put in place credible implementation systems, the most notable being the Government’s Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for all externally financed projects/programs in Cambodia comprising of the SOP Manual, the Procurement Manual and the Financial Management Manual.

                        This Governance Manual shall serve as the framework for the conduct of business of the CCC. It is developed based on the Global Fund Guidelines on the Purpose, Structure and Composition of Country Coordinating Mechanisms and Requirements for Grant Eligibility and reflects its requirements, standards and recommendations.
